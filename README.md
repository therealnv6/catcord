> CatCord is a minimal and lightweight discord client.

## Why?

My main reason for making this was supporting normally unsupported platforms.
Sadly, there are many platforms Discord doesn't support. Out of the operating
systems I use, there was already one that simply wasn't supported by discord,
being [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)

- [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/): doesn't work natively

Besides the official Discord client not working on FreeBSD, there are more
issues with the native Discord client, mainly:

- [wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/): Discord under wayland does not
  support screensharing
- [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): Don't get me wrong, Electron is a
  very cool and versatile framework, it just uses too much resources for a
  Discord client.
